### Three Years
_This is the Operational baseline (Today -- 2021 to 2024)_

_In three years we will be selling yesterday's innovations_

* Today's customers are not all comfortable using VMs, a 20 year old technology
* Today's customers are (mostly) still our customers in three years
* Today's products don't work together and _that is the biggest problem to solve in the next three years_ because if we don't solve it we can't do anything else.
  1. move HTTPS config from A to B to C (portability between products)
  2. all feature modules on all data planes
  3. shared engineering standards
  4. opinionated reference architecture from app to application  


_In three years we will *also* be selling simplification_

* Concept to Code as a Service (C2CaaS) 

  Eg., quickly build an app, package that app with an Nginx Unit application server, deploy that app to the Cloud or the Edge with an Operations as a Service SaaS application.

### On the Edge is a Thing
_How do you "thingify" a complex system?_

### Things connect to Platforms
_How do you operate, secure, and trust Things you can't touch?_

### Services to Create Adaptive Applications (Concept to Code to Customer)
_How do you trust and monetize a service you can't control?_




## Five Years
_This is the Planning baseline (Tomorrow -- 2024 to 2026)_

_In five years we will be selling today's innovations_


## Seven Years
_This is the Development baseline (Day after tomorrow -- 2026 to 2029)_

_In seven years we will be selling tomorrow's innovations_
